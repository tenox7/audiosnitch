Log audio/sound activity on macOS.

Have you ever gotten an audio notification and you wanted to know where it came from?

This app can tell you.

## System Sound Effects

If you see audio from **System Sound Effects** / `systemsoundserverd`, at this moment I'm not able to trace who send it exactly. But most of these come from the **Notification Center**.
